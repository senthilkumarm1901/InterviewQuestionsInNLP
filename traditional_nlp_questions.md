# Questions related to Traditional ML and NLP

<details> <summary>1. What are <code>discriminative</code> and <code>generative</code> ML models? Explain with examples</summary>
<br>
  
  Difference between `discriminative` and `generative` models [1]: 
  
  >  a discriminative machine learning trains a model by learning parameters that maximise the conditional probability P(Y|X), but a generative model learns parameters by maximising the joint probability P(X,Y)
  
  Generative Models [1] <br>
  > Generative models are a class of statistical models that generate new data instances. These models are generally/mostly used in *unsupervised machine learning*. E.g.: Naive Bayes, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Gaussian Mixture Models etc., 
 
  <br>
  
  Discriminative Models [1] <br>
  > The discriminative model is used particularly for supervised machine learning. Also called a conditional model, it learns the boundaries between classes or labels in a dataset. E.g.: SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.,
